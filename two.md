# About me

[back](./)

<p> I'm a current graduate student at Villanova University studying Applied Statistics. I started my college career at Drexel University studying Digital Media but ended up graduating from Millersville University with a double major in Political Economics and Philosophy an a minor in Mathematics.</p>

<p> After my undergrad, I worked in various roles in the banking industry with a focus in 401k education and wealth management.</p>

<p> I enjoy discovering new things, especially related to music and films. I also enjoy playing board games and card games but find it hard to play anything other the Magic: The Gathering when I have free time. </p>
